	 * 2...What is a race condition? How will you find and solve race condition show with proper running code ?
	 * 
	 * Java is a multi-threaded programming language and there is a higher risk to occur race conditions. 
	 * Because the same resource may be accessed by multiple threads at the same time and may change the data.
	 *  A race-condition	is a condition in which the critical section (a part of the program where shared memory is
	 *   accessed) is concurrently	executed by two or more threads. It leads to incorrect behavior of a program. */
