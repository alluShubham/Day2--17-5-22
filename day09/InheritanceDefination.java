//Why is multiple inheritance not supported in Java at class level ?

// Ans:  When a class extends an event, it inherits the event's annotations,
//
//settings, and fields. However, a class doesn't inherit private fields or
//
//annotations that lack the @java.lang.Inherited meta-annotation.
